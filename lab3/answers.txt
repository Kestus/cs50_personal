sort1 uses: Bubble sort

sorted50000:    real - 0m4.157s
random50000:    real - 0m17.864s
reversed50000:  real - 0m13.406s

How do you know?: Wery fast in case of a sorted file, but wery slow in case of reverced
file. Big difference between best and worst cases is a sign of a Bubble algorithm.


sort2 uses: Merge sort

sorted50000:    real - 0m3.537s
random50000:    real - 0m2.480s
reversed50000:  real - 0m3.481s

How do you know?: Fastest out of three algorithms. Small difference between best 
case scenario (sorted)and worst case (reversed).


sort3 uses: Selection sort

sorted50000:    real - 0m11.570s
random50000:    real - 0m8.534s
reversed50000:  real - 0m8.667s

How do you know?: Average speed, small difference between best and worst case scenario.
